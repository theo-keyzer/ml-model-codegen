Section declaration 2 Component Declaration
D To declare a Distributionrule component in a .unit file:
D
D ```
D Comp Distributionrule parent . Find
D Element distribution key . + Distribution name (normal, categorical, gumbel, etc)
D Element params word . + Parameter names (comma-separated)
D Element reparam word . + true/false for reparameterization trick support
D Element desc text . * Description
D ```
D
D This creates a root-level component that will be searchable by name across the entire schema.


Section variables 2 Variable fields
D ```
D ${distribution}
D ${params}
D ${reparam}
D ${desc}
D ```

Artifact reference_resolution_guide workflow overview
O Multi-pass reference resolution algorithm that handles complex reference chains.

Section resolution_order 2 Resolution Order
D References resolve in passes until stable:
D
D **Pass 1: Direct References**
D - ref: Direct lookup in global index
D - link: Lookup in parent's child index
D
D **Pass 2+: Derived References**
D - ref_copy: Copies resolved reference from previous field
D - ref_child: Looks up child in previously referenced component
D - up_copy: Walks parent chain to find ancestor
D
D The loader repeats passes until error count stops changing (typically 2-4 passes).

Section chaining_pattern 2 Common Chaining Pattern
D ```
D Element base_ref    ref       Target    +
D Element child_ref   ref_child ChildType +
D ```
D First field resolves Target by name, second field looks up ChildType within that Target.

Section up_chain_pattern 2 Up-Chain Pattern
D ```
D Element context     up_copy   Ancestor  +
D Element target      ref_child ChildType +
D ```
D First field walks parents to find Ancestor, second field looks up ChildType within it.
