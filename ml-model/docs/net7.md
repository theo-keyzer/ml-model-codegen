# 🌐 Neuro-Emergent Modeling Framework  
### A Next-Generation DSL for Neuromorphic, Memristive, and Evolutionary AI

> **"We're not just building AI models — we're engineering artificial minds that grow, adapt, and evolve."**

---

## 🎯 Vision

The `net7.unit` framework enables the **specification, simulation, and deployment of neuro-emergent systems** — intelligent architectures that go beyond static neural networks to incorporate:
- 🧠 **Neuromorphic spiking dynamics**
- 💾 **Memristive in-memory compute**
- 🧬 **Evolutionary structure and learning**
- 🔁 **Self-reconfiguration and morphogenesis**
- ⚖️ **Hardware-aware energy and reliability constraints**

This is not a traditional deep learning framework.  
It's a **meta-language for synthetic intelligence ecosystems**, where models **compute**, **learn**, **morph**, and **endure**.

- ✅ **Survive hardware faults and degradation**
- ✅ **Design themselves for specific tasks and constraints**

This framework is the **first DSL to unify**:
- 🧠 Biological plausibility
- 💾 Physical device constraints
- 🧬 Evolutionary design
- ⚖️ Formal verification
