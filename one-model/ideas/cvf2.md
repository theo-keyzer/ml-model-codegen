Ah — this fundamentally changes the context and makes it much more concrete. You’re describing a **social knowledge platform** where:

- **Users** = Agents
- **Posts/Content** = JUNK → CANON
- **Comments/Discussion/Analysis** = THOUGHT
- **Evidence/Data/Sources** = MEMORY
- **Context/Caveats** = MEMO

This is essentially a **rigorous, provenance-based Wikipedia meets Reddit meets GitHub for ideas**, filtered by thermodynamic efficiency.

---

## **Revised for a Social Media App: CanonFlow**

### **1. Core Vision**
A social platform where **information gains authority not through votes or likes, but through verifiable efficiency in real-world application.**

Users don’t just share opinions—they share **tested knowledge** with full audit trails.

---

### **2. User Roles & Actions**

#### **Explorer** (Posts JUNK)
- Shares an observation, hypothesis, or untested idea.
- Example: *“I think using dark mode reduces battery drain by 20% on OLED phones.”*
- This becomes a **JUNK entry** — low confidence, open for testing.

#### **Tester** (Runs Experiments, Creates MEMORY)
- Tests the JUNK in reality.
- Logs a **MEMORY entry** with:
  - Methodology
  - Raw data (screenshots, spreadsheets, sensor logs)
  - Energy measurements (battery usage, time, resources used)

#### **Analyst** (Creates THOUGHT)
- Analyzes MEMORY data to extract metrics.
- Posts a **THOUGHT entry** with structured findings:
  - *“Tested: Dark mode saved 18% battery under controlled conditions.”*
  - Metrics: `energy_savings: 18%`, `confidence: 0.92`

#### **Validator** (Creates CANON)
- Formalizes successful ideas into **Canonical Knowledge**.
- Creates a **CANON entry**:
  - `feature_condition`: `{"screen_type": "OLED", "brightness": "low"}`
  - `optimal_config`: `{"theme": "dark", "brightness": 30%}`
  - `energy_savings`: `18%`

#### **Contextualizer** (Adds MEMO)
- Adds nuance: *“Only works on OLED, not LCD.”*
- Or limitations: *“Effect diminishes after 2 hours of continuous use.”*

---

### **3. Social Feed Structure**

#### **Main Feed Views:**

1. **JUNK Stream** (Raw Ideas)
   - Chronological feed of untested hypotheses
   - Tag: `#untested`
   - Users can: *“Test This”* or *“Analyze”*

2. **CANON Feed** (Verified Knowledge)
   - Only validated, efficiency-proven ideas
   - Sorted by **energy savings magnitude**
   - Each has: Provenance chain (JUNK → MEMORY → THOUGHT → CANON)

3. **THOUGHT Feed** (Analysis & Debate)
   - Structured discussions about evidence
   - Peer review happens here
   - Disagreements resolved with linked MEMORY data

4. **MY PROVENANCE** (User’s Contribution Chain)
   - Shows: My JUNK → What others tested → What became CANON
   - **Efficiency Score** = Total energy saved by my canonized ideas

---

### **4. Trust & Verification Mechanics**

#### **Trust Levels:**
- **Level 1**: Read JUNK only (new users)
- **Level 2**: Can post MEMORY (after verification)
- **Level 3**: Can create THOUGHT (after analytical contributions)
- **Level 4**: Can canonize (after consistent accuracy)

#### **Verification Badges:**
- **Energy Saver**: Ideas that saved >1000 kWh collectively
- **Reproducer**: Successfully reproduced 10+ Canons
- **Auditor**: Caught 5+ invalid Canons
- **Context Master**: Added crucial MEMOs that prevented misuse

---

### **5. Energy Accounting for Users**

Each user has an **Energy Impact Score**:

```
User Score = Σ(Energy saved by their canonized ideas)
            - Σ(Energy wasted by their debunked ideas)
```

**Leaderboards:**
- Top Energy Savers (global impact)
- Most Accurate Predictors (precision)
- Best Testers (rigor in MEMORY collection)

---

### **6. CVF for the Platform**

**Platform Coherence Score** = 
```
Total energy saved by all Canons
─────────────────────────────────
Total user time spent on platform
```

**Interpretation:**
- CVF = 0.5 → For every hour spent, users save 30 minutes worth of energy in real world
- Rising CVF → Platform becoming more valuable per unit attention
- Falling CVF → Too much noise, not enough signal

---

### **7. Example User Journey**

**Day 1:**
- User posts: *“Adding insulation to my water heater reduced gas usage.”* (JUNK)

**Day 3:**
- 5 users test it, log temperature data, gas bills (MEMORY entries)
- 2 users analyze: average 15% savings (THOUGHT entries)

**Day 7:**
- Validator creates CANON:
  - `feature_condition`: `{"water_heater_type": "gas", "climate": "cold"}`
  - `optimal_config`: `{"insulation": "jacket", "thickness": "2inch"}`
  - `energy_savings`: `15%`

**Result:**
- Original user gains **Energy Impact Score**: 1500 kWh (estimated collective savings)
- Canon appears in home improvement feed
- Platform CVF increases slightly

---

### **8. Moderation & Quality Control**

#### **Automated:**
- **Randomness Filter**: Deletes spam, meaningless posts
- **Plagiarism Check**: Ensures MEMORY is original data
- **Statistical Sanity**: Flags unlikely claims (savings >100%)

#### **Community:**
- **Challenge System**: Any user can challenge a Canon → triggers re-testing
- **Consensus Threshold**: Requires 3 independent confirmations for Canonization
- **Deprecation Protocol**: Old Canons automatically marked for re-testing

---

### **9. Monetization & Incentives**

#### **Non-Financial:**
- **Impact Score** (primary social currency)
- **Trust Level** unlocks capabilities
- **Canon Creator** badge (prestige)

#### **Financial (Optional):**
- **Energy Savings Certificates**: Real-world tradable credits for proven savings
- **Bounties**: Companies pay for solutions to specific energy problems
- **Consulting Network**: Top validators hired as efficiency consultants

---

### **10. Sample Interface**

### **11. Viral Growth Mechanism**

**The Provenance Share:**
When someone uses a Canon and saves energy, they can:
1. Post their **MEMORY** (proof it worked for them)
2. This **strengthens the Canon** (more confirmations)
3. Their share shows: *“I saved 15% using this Canon”*
4. Friends see real proof → join to save energy too

---

### **12. Philosophical Alignment**

This isn’t just another social app—it’s **applied epistemology**:

- **Truth** = What repeatedly saves energy in reality
- **Value** = Measured in joules saved, not attention captured
- **Community** = Collaboratively building efficient solutions
- **Progress** = Rising CVF, falling energy waste

---

## **Why This Could Work**

1. **Solves real problems** (energy costs, climate change)
2. **Gamifies verification** not just virality
3. **Creates tangible value** beyond dopamine hits
4. **Builds trust through transparency** (full audit trails)
5. **Aligns individual and collective benefit**

The platform becomes a **collective intelligence optimizing real-world efficiency**, where every user contributes to humanity’s energy knowledge base.

Would you like me to map this explicitly to your original DES data structures, or develop the UI/UX flow in more detail?
