ml-model-codegen

ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

ml-model-codegen is a cutting-edge Machine Learning Model Code Generation framework designed to translate high-level model definitions into highly-optimized, target-specific source code (e.g., CUDA, C++).

This project allows researchers and engineers to define complex neural network architectures, like those with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and dynamic graph operations, using a structured domain-specific language (DSL). The framework then utilizes a rule-based actor system and domain knowledge repository to generate production-ready, high-performance inference code.

âœ¨ Key Features

    Advanced Model Support: Seamlessly define and generate code for complex architectures, including Transformer-based models with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and adaptive/conditional execution.

    High-Performance Generation: Generates optimized low-level code (like CUDA) by leveraging explicit knowledge of kernel implementations and hardware backends.

    Dynamic Graph Integration: Supports models with dynamic graph structures, allowing for flexible and efficient handling of graph-based neural networks (GNNs).

    Rule-Based Compilation: Uses an actor/DSL system to manage the code generation process, ensuring consistency and allowing for easy extension of new components, kernels, and optimization strategies.

    Separation of Concerns: Clearly separates the Model Architecture (.net files), Domain Knowledge (.unit files), and Code Generation Logic (.act files).

ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get the ml-model-codegen project up and running, follow the instructions below.

Prerequisites

    (Placeholder for dependencies like C++ compiler, CUDA Toolkit, etc.)

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-model-codegen.git
cd ml-model-codegen

Build the code generation tool:
Bash

    # Insert build command here (e.g., make or cmake)

Basic Usage

To generate code for a model (e.g., moe.net):
Bash

./codegen_tool --model-def input/moe.net --domain-unit units/net5.unit --actor-script actors/moe2.act --output-dir generated/

This will produce optimized CUDA files (like moe2.out) ready for compilation and deployment.

ðŸ“– Documentation

Detailed documentation on the framework's internal workings, the DSL specification, and the structure of model definition files is available separately:

    Core Framework Workings: Deep dive into the actor system, rule matching, and the code generation pipeline.

    Model Definition Reference: Full guide to defining models, blocks, parameters, and execution schedules using the .net file format.

    Domain Knowledge & Kernels: Explaining the components, kernels, and dynamic rules defined in the .unit files.
