Artifact reference-resolution-guide workflow overview
O Multi-pass reference resolution algorithm that handles complex reference chains.

Section resolution_order 2 Resolution Order
D References resolve in passes until stable:
D
D **Pass 1: Direct References**
D - `ref`: Direct lookup in global index
D - `link`: Lookup in parent's child index
D
D **Pass 2+: Derived References**
D - `ref_copy`: Copies resolved reference from previous field
D - `ref_child`: Looks up child in previously referenced component
D - `up_copy`: Walks parent chain to find ancestor
D
D The loader repeats passes until error count stops changing (typically 2-4 passes).

Section chaining_pattern 2 Common Chaining Pattern
D ```
D Element base_ref    ref       Target    +
D Element child_ref   ref_child ChildType +
D ```
D First field resolves Target by name, second field looks up ChildType within that Target.

Section up_chain_pattern 2 Up-Chain Pattern
D ```
D Element context     up_copy   Ancestor  +
D Element target      ref_child ChildType +
D ```
D First field walks parents to find Ancestor, second field looks up ChildType within it.

Section common_patterns 2 Common Design Patterns
D
D **Pattern 1: Direct Reference**
D ```
D Element target ref ComponentType +
D ```
D Simple global lookup.
D
D **Pattern 2: Reference Chain**
D ```
D Element parent_ref   ref       Parent +
D Element child_ref    ref_child Child  +
D ```
D Two-level lookup: resolve parent, then find child within parent.
D
D **Pattern 3: Ancestor Lookup**
D ```
D Element ancestor  up_copy   Ancestor +
D Element target    ref_child Target   +
D ```
D Navigate up hierarchy to find ancestor, then look up child within it.
D
D **Pattern 4: Reference Reuse**
D ```
D Element original  ref      Target +
D Element copy      ref_copy Target +
D ```
D Resolve once, copy pointer multiple times for efficiency.
D
D **Pattern 5: Sibling Link**
D ```
D Element sibling link SiblingType +
D ```
D Reference sibling component under same parent.
